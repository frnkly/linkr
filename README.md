# Linkr
Linkr was a [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/) extension that simplified the task of linking to internal articles within Joomla! websites. With well over 100,000 downloads throughout its life, it was popular back when there was no easy way of creating inbound links.

Although this code is no longer being maintained, I decided to move it here so that it remains open and available.
